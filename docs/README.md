## üî• News
- *2024.8.14*: We‚Äôre excited to announce the release of CURE‚Äôs [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11016).
- *2024.8.22*: We‚Äôre excited to announce the release of CURE‚Äôs [model](https://huggingface.co/bytedance-research/CURE).

## üìö Algorithm Overview
![](https://github.com/Bytedance-CURE/CURE/blob/master/main.png) 

In Stage 1, given an input query 
$q$, the policy model produces a pool of candidate responses. We compute token-level entropy to identify critical tokens (high entropy), extract the clauses immediately preceding those tokens, append them to 
$q$ to form refined prompts, and query the model again. The newly generated responses are aggregated with the original ones and jointly optimized within a single group. In Stage 2, we continue training to translate the exploration bonus into realized performance.

## üìö Experimental Results

Comparison of Entropy comparison of CURE-First-Stage and other methods at temperature 1.0.

![](https://github.com/Bytedance-CURE/CURE/blob/master/main_table.jpg)

CURE performs competitively compared with other algorithms. We report avg@32 for AIME24, AIME25, and AMC23 and avg@1 for others.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
Our code has been incorporated into VERL as a plugin, located in [recipe-CURE](https://github.com/Bytedance-CURE/CURE/tree/master/recipe)
### 1. Prepare the environment
Exactly the same as the environment setup in [verl](https://github.com/volcengine/verl), no additional configuration is required. In our actual workflow, we executed the following operations directly within the released image.
```bash
cd CURE
pip install --no-deps -e .
pip install --no-deps git+https://github.com/=hiyouga/MathRuler.git
pip install math_verify
```
### 2. Prepare the dataset and model
For training, simply download the dataset from [DAPO-Math-17K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Math-17k) and set its path as `TRAIN_FILE` in the [startup script](https://github.com/Bytedance-CURE/CURE/blob/master/recipe/dapo_cure/run_cure_stage_1.sh). We use [Qwen-2.5-Math-Base](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Math-7B) as the training baseline; download it and set its path as `CKPTS_DIR` in the same script.
> We also recommend downloading [AIME-2024](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BytedTsinghua-SIA/AIME-2024) and setting its path as `TEST_FILE` in the same script.


## üöÄ Train
### 1. First Stage Training
```bash
cd CURE
sh ./recipe/CURE_First_Stage/run_cure_stage_1.sh
```

### 2. Second Stage Training
```bash
cd CURE
sh ./recipe/CURE_Second_Stage/run_cure_stage_2.sh
```
